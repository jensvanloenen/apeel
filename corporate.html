      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>Our campaign is created to see the beauty in what already exists around us. To appreciate and to be content. Our message is that we can live a content life, not worrying about wanting more by being happy with less.</p>
      <p>Instagram and Twitter have been our main focusses. Both social media platforms are the one of the most used social media platforms today. 
Instagram was used to introduce our brand with quotes, statements, and interactive content. To also post content that indicated what our product might be about. But if the consumer wanted to find out, they would have to click on the link in our bio which leads to our website. 
Twitter was used for quick info and nice quotes to start the day. We researched our main subject which is contentment and wanted to increase the interest of potential consumers by posting small amounts information, about Buddhism for example.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>Regarding our social media activity we learned that a social media campaign has a lot to do with content planning, consistency, and staying interactive. We continually kept showing interest in other brands. We started following their accounts on instagram, continued with liking their posts and viewing their stories. By paying attention to these brands accounts, we received support back the brands themselves. They too started following our account and liking our posts. This ultimately created a larger following for our brand.</p>
		<p>We decided to start off with organic posting on our social media pages. Our brand wanted to understand how far we could reach consumers without having to use paid advertisements. The social media pages we used include Twitter and Instagram. It was noticeable that we achieved barely any reach outside of our own social circles. By reposting our posts and trying to create brand awareness, we did not reach enough consumers that were unknown to us. What did work was posting instagram stories, which helped to remind followers to check out our posts. </p>
		<p>When our brand started to post on the social media pages we wanted to make sure to use the tools available for promoting our brand, and decided to use hashtags. We conducted research regarding how many hashtags would be most effective to use per post. We came to the conclusion to only use two to three hashtags per post. Up to 30 hashtags would be acceptable, but it is not recommended. Using a few hashtags should make it easier for instagram to target our desired consumer demographic. Our brand eventually used two to three per post on both social media pages. This would give our posts a more clean and clear look, but we unfortunately discovered that using minimal hashtags did not necessarily help as well as we hoped to. Our engagement did not noticeably improve as much as we hoped.</p>
		<p>We anticipated a slow start when launching our brand. Especially due to the fact that we wanted to see how far our brand would reach with only organic posting. We estimated that Instagram would grow a larger audience quicker. Twitter would take more time, as we expected. 
</p>
		<p>Because our target audience spends plenty of time on social media platforms, we expected that gaining engagement quickly would not be too much of a challenge. But this was more difficult than we had expected. What our brand should have done differently is focus more on our social media planning. We did not pay enough attention to the amount of time that was needed to post all our posts and stories. We learned that posting consistent with time in between our posts could have created more engagement, rather than sending out multiple posts at the same time. When reflecting on our social media plan, it shows us that we had too much planned to post in a limited span of time. Posting a lot on the same day on Instagram results in not all posts showing up on the feeds of our consumers. This ultimately created less engagement. When we posted on Instagram we used three pictures at the same time, to make our feed look aesthetically pleasing and clearer. But as previously mentioned, posting a lot at the same time does not result in more engagement.
</p>
		<p>A different approach to our social media strategy should have been conducting more thorough research about our mission statement, especially about contentment. Our brand focusses on contentment and how that is achieved. When researching the subject, we stumbled upon Buddhism and decided to post the research as quick info on our Twitter page. We believe that if we had done more thorough research, we could have implemented for example Buddhism more into our website or Instagram. This would have shown consumers that an entire culture sees contentment as one of the greatest wealth’s. Which could raise a lot of interest in many consumers’ minds. </p>
		
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>Our brand has created two social media pages to create awareness for our brand. These social media pages include Instagram and Twitter. On these pages we have posted different types of content. Instagram has a total of 15 posts and three stories. The stories have been put as a highlight on our page to be able to look at them repeatedly. Twitter has a total of six posts. Besides social media, we have created website for our brand. This is where we provide information about our brand, our team and provide an advertisement that has been created to promote our brand with a soft sell approach. 
</p>
      <p>So, we have created a website, two social media pages on Instagram and Twitter. If the brand should continue, we would start off with putting money in advertising. As previously mentioned, we worked with organic posting, which did not work as effective as we had hoped. We will begin with putting a small amount such as 30 euros into Instagram advertisements. Five euros per day spread out in six days. The estimated number of reaches is between 3.700 to 9.700 in total. We wanted to achieve this amount in two months, so to have at least 4000 reaches in six days would help our brand grow much quicker. We will then continue to promote our website on Instagram by posting the link on our page. Our brand will focus advertising on Instagram and continue to use Twitter as a quick info page, but not yet use for paid advertising. When we notice the paid advertising becomes successful on Instagram, we will start with Twitter advertising. 
</p>
      <p>Secondly our brand plans to create more interactive content to post on our social media pages. That is why we will create a tiktok page to post video content. TikTok is known worldwide for their viral 15 second videos. The content we post would consist out of videos that talk about our brand and our product. We could create videos interacting with people asking them personal questions, such as how content they are with their lives or what they understand when thinking about the word contentment. If we want to post more product related content, posts will be made regarding food waste and teasers shown of our product. If the viewer would want to see our actual product, they would have to visit our website which would be linked on our page.  
</p>
		<p>Another future plan would be for our brand to collab with one or multiple other brands. The collabs would make it possible to gain support and even loyalty from the other brands existing consumers, as well can ours become loyal to them. Both brands could together arrange giveaways on social media. The giveaways can create more exposure. By winning a giveaway the consumer would have to repost our message and tag a few friends in the comment section of the post (to be considered). This ultimately leads to more exposure for both brands, a win-win situation.</p>
		<p>Our experience regarding this project related to the marketing assignment is as follows. We learned that we should immediately start with paid advertising on the social media platforms. This would give us a head start and quite quickly help us to reach the 1500 views. Besides paid advertising, we should have begun much earlier with posting our content. If we had left more time in between our posts, it would have given consumers more time to find our page, check it out and engage if they were interested. Posting everything in a timeframe of three days is not enough time. At least three weeks should have sufficed.
